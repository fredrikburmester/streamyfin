## 🧪 Experimental Features

Streamyfin includes some exciting experimental features like media downloading and Chromecast support. These are still in development, and we appreciate your patience and feedback as we work to improve them.

### Downloading

Downloading works by using ffmpeg to convert an HLS stream into a video file on the device. This means that you can download and view any file you can stream! The file is converted by Jellyfin on the server in real time as it is downloaded. This means a **bit longer download times** but supports any file that your server can transcode.

### Chromecast

Chromecast support is still in development, and we're working on improving it. Currently, it supports casting videos and audio, but we're working on adding support for subtitles and other features.

## Plugins

In Streamyfin we have built-in support for a few plugins. These plugins are not required to use Streamyfin, but they add some extra functionality.

### Collection rows

Jellyfin collections can be shown as rows or carousel on the home screen.
The following tags can be added to a collection to provide this functionality.

Available tags:

- sf_promoted: will make the collection a row at home
- sf_carousel: will make the collection a carousel on home.

A plugin exists to create collections based on external sources like mdblist. This make the automatic process of managing collections such as trending, most watched, etc.
See [Collection Import Plugin](https://github.com/lostb1t/jellyfin-plugin-collection-import) for more info.

### Jellysearch

[Jellysearch](https://gitlab.com/DomiStyle/jellysearch) now works with Streamyfin! 🚀

> A fast full-text search proxy for Jellyfin. Integrates seamlessly with most Jellyfin clients.

To access the Streamyfin beta, you need to subscribe to the Member tier (or higher) on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/streamyfin). This will give you immediate access to the ⁠🧪-public-beta channel on Discord and i'll know that you have subscribed. This is where i'll post APKs and IPAs.
