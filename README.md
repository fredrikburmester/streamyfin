## üß™ Experimental Features

Streamyfin includes some exciting experimental features like media downloading and Chromecast support. These are still in development, and we appreciate your patience and feedback as we work to improve them.

### Downloading

Downloading works by using ffmpeg to convert a HLS stream into a video file on the device. This means that you can download and view any file you can stream! The file is converted by Jellyfin on the server in real time as it is downloaded. This means a **bit longer download times** but supports any file that your server can transcode.

### Collection rows

Jellyfin collections can be shown as rows or carousel on the home screen.
The following tags can be added to an collection to provide this functionality. 

Avaiable tags:
- sf_promoted: Wil make the collection an row on home
- sf_carousel: Wil make the collection an carousel on home.

A plugin exists to create collections based on external sources like mdblist. This makes managing collections like trending, most watched etc an automatic process.
See [Collection Import Plugin](https://github.com/lostb1t/jellyfin-plugin-collection-import) for more info.
